### About me
My name is Yuri, I am 36 years old. I work as a freelancer in an educational project for entrepreneurs. I am actively studying programming, inspired by Web development. I like to spend my free time with my parents and friends. I am actively engaged in sports, like to travel and make new acquaintances.  

I am currently actively studying English and the Java Script programming language.  

Every day before going to bed I try to read 25 sheets of fiction. The last book I read was *["The Theory of Castes and roles"](https://www.litres.ru/aleksey-krol/teoriya-kast-i-roley/otzivi/)* by Alex Kroll, I highly recommend it.  

>Never regret anything, because at a certain moment it was exactly what you wanted......
